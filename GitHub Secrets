# How to set up GitHub Secret keys
#  GitHub Secrets are a way to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as API keys, tokens, or passwords, used in your GitHub Actions workflows. Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by GitHub Actions workflows associated with the same repository. This provides a secure method to handle confidential data without exposing it in your code or workflow configuration.
# GitHub Secrets:

#Go to your GitHub repository.
#Click on "Settings" > "Secrets" > "New repository secret."
#Add two secrets: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and set their values to your AWS access key ID and secret access key
# {secure way to store your aws access keys}
